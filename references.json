    "abstract": "<jats:p>Several attempts have already been made to interpret the well-established results of biometry in accordance with the Mendelian scheme of inheritance. It is here attempted to ascertain the biometrical properties of a population of a more general type than has hitherto been examined, inheritance in which follows this scheme. It is hoped that in this way it will be possible to make a more exact analysis of the causes of human variability. The great body of available statistics show us that the deviations of a human measurement from its mean follow very closely the Normal Law of Errors, and, therefore, that the variability may be uniformly measured by the standard deviation corresponding to the square root of the mean square error. When there are two independent causes of variability capable of producing in an otherwise uniform population distributions with standard deviations σ<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> and σ<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, it is found that the distribution, when both causes act together, has a standard deviation <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" mime-subtype=\"gif\" mimetype=\"image\" xlink:type=\"simple\" xlink:href=\"S0080456800012163_inline1\" />. It is therefore desirable in analysing the causes of variability to deal with the square of the standard deviation as the measure of variability. We shall term this quantity the Variance of the normal population to which it refers, and we may now ascribe to the constituent causes fractions or percentages of the total variance which they together produce. It is desirable on the one hand that the elementary ideas at the basis of the calculus of correlations should be clearly understood, and easily expressed in ordinary language, and on the other that loose phrases about the “percentage of causation,” which obscure the essential distinction between the individual and the population, should be carefully avoided.</jats:p>",

Because of limitations of classical clustering methods, numerous alternative module detection methods have been proposed, which improve upon clustering by handling co-expression in only a subset of samples, modelling the regulatory network, and/or allowing overlap between modules. In this study we use known regulatory networks to do a comprehensive and robust evaluation of these different methods. Overall, decomposition methods outperform all other strategies, while we do not find a clear advantage of biclustering and network inference-based approaches on large gene expression datasets. Using our evaluation workflow, we also investigate several practical aspects of module detection, such as parameter estimation and the use of alternative similarity measures, and conclude with recommendations for the further development of these methods.</jats:p>",

Here we derive a mathematical expression to compute PrediXcan (a gene mapping approach) results using summary data (S-PrediXcan) and show its accuracy and general robustness to misspecified reference sets. We apply this framework to 44 GTEx tissues and 100+ phenotypes from GWAS and meta-analysis studies, creating a growing public catalog of associations that seeks to capture the effects of gene expression variation on human phenotypes. Replication in an independent cohort is shown. Most of the associations are tissue specific, suggesting context specificity of the trait etiology. Colocalized significant associations in unexpected tissues underscore the need for an agnostic scanning of multiple contexts to improve our ability to detect causal regulatory mechanisms. Monogenic disease genes are enriched among significant associations for related traits, suggesting that smaller alterations of these genes may cause a spectrum of milder phenotypes.</jats:p>",

Few studies have explored the interplay between monogenic and polygenic risk. Here, we study 80,928 individuals to examine whether polygenic background can modify penetrance of disease in tier 1 genomic conditions — familial hypercholesterolemia, hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, and Lynch syndrome. Among carriers of a monogenic risk variant, we estimate substantial gradients in disease risk based on polygenic background — the probability of disease by age 75 years ranged from 17% to 78% for coronary artery disease, 13% to 76% for breast cancer, and 11% to 80% for colon cancer. We propose that accounting for polygenic background is likely to increase accuracy of risk estimation for individuals who inherit a monogenic risk variant.</jats:p>",

One reason is the complexity of alternative splicing events producing many unknown isoforms. Here, we propose two approaches, namely integration and selection, for this complexity by focusing on protein-structure of isoforms. First, we integrate isoforms with the same coding sequence (CDS) and identify 369-601 integrated-isoform ratio QTLs (i<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>-rQTLs), which altered protein-structure, in six immune subsets. Second, we select CDS incomplete isoforms annotated in GENCODE and identify 175-337 isoform-ratio QTL (i-rQTL). By comprehensive long-read capture RNA-sequencing among these incomplete isoforms, we reveal 29 full-length isoforms with unannotated CDSs associated with GWAS traits. Furthermore, we show that disease-causal sQTL genes can be identified by evaluating their trans-eQTL effects. Our approaches highlight the understudied role of protein-altering sQTLs and are broadly applicable to other tissues and diseases.</jats:p>",

Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. Transcriptome-wide association studies have helped uncover the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observe that diseases are significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach is accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we find that functionally important players lack associations but are prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.</jats:p>",

In this review, we give a brief overview on the statistical and methodological foundations commonly used in GRN inference methods. We then compare and contrast the latest state-of-the-art GRN inference methods for single-cell matched multi-omics data, and discuss their assumptions, limitations and opportunities. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future directions that hold promise for further advancements in this rapidly developing field.</jats:p>",

In parallel, advances in deep learning allow rapid analysis of newly generated query datasets by mapping them into reference atlases. However, existing data transformations learned to map query data are not easily explainable using biologically known concepts such as genes or pathways. Here we propose expiMap, a biologically informed deep-learning architecture that enables single-cell reference mapping. ExpiMap learns to map cells into biologically understandable components representing known ‘gene programs’. The activity of each cell for a gene program is learned while simultaneously refining them and learning de novo programs. We show that expiMap compares favourably to existing methods while bringing an additional layer of interpretability to integrative single-cell analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate its applicability to analyse single-cell perturbation responses in different tissues and species and resolve responses of patients who have coronavirus disease 2019 to different treatments across cell types.</jats:p>",

Nevertheless, identifying critical genes underlying those significant variants has been a great task. Transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) is an instrumental post-analysis to detect significant gene-trait associations focusing on modeling transcription-level regulations, which has made numerous progresses in recent years. Leveraging from expression quantitative loci (eQTL) regulation information, TWAS has advantages in detecting functioning genes regulated by disease-associated variants, thus providing insight into mechanisms of diseases and other phenotypes. Considering its vast potential, this review article comprehensively summarizes TWAS, including the methodology, applications and available resources.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The reconciliation between Mendelian inheritance of discrete traits and the genetically based correlation between relatives for quantitative traits was Fisher’s infinitesimal model of a large number of genetic variants, each with very small effects, whose causal effects could not be individually identified. The development of genome-wide genetic association studies (GWAS) raised the hope that it would be possible to identify single polymorphic variants with identifiable functional effects on complex traits. It soon became clear that, with larger and larger GWAS on more and more complex traits, most of the significant associations had such small effects, that identifying their individual functional effects was essentially hopeless. Polygenic risk scores that provide an overall estimate of the genetic propensity to a trait at the individual level have been developed using GWAS data. These provide useful identification of groups of individuals with substantially increased risks, which can lead to recommendations of medical treatments or behavioral modifications to reduce risks. However, each such claim will require extensive investigation to justify its practical application. The challenge now is to use limited genetic association studies to find individually identifiable variants of significant functional effect that can help to understand the molecular basis of complex diseases and traits, and so lead to improved disease prevention and treatment. This can best be achieved by 1) the study of rare variants, often chosen by careful candidate assessment, and 2) the careful choice of phenotypes, often extremes of a quantitative variable, or traits with relatively high heritability.</jats:p>",

Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) is a widely used method for module detection based on the computation of eigengenes, the weights of the first principal component for the module gene expression matrix. This eigengene has been used as a centroid in a <jats:italic>k</jats:italic>-means algorithm to improve module memberships. In this paper, we present four new module representatives: the eigengene subspace, flag mean, flag median and module expression vector. The eigengene subspace, flag mean and flag median are subspace module representatives which capture more variance of the gene expression within a module. The module expression vector is a weighted centroid of the module which leverages the structure of the module gene co-expression network. We use these module representatives in Linde–Buzo–Gray clustering algorithms to refine WGCNA module membership. We evaluate these methodologies on two transcriptomics data sets. We find that most of our module refinement techniques improve upon the WGCNA modules by two statistics: (1) module classification between phenotype and (2) module biological significance according to Gene Ontology terms.</jats:p>",

We show that in the vast majority of our testing scenarios, VAE achieves similar or better performances than the most widely used imputation standards, while having a computational advantage at evaluation time. When dealing with data missing not at random (e.g., few values are missing), we develop simple yet effective methodologies to leverage the prior knowledge about missing data. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of varying latent space regularization strength in VAE on the imputation performances and, in this context, show why VAE has a better imputation capacity compared to a regular deterministic auto-encoder.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>We describe a deep learning imputation framework for transcriptome and methylome data using a VAE and show that it can be a preferable alternative to traditional methods for data imputation, especially in the setting of large-scale data and certain missing-not-at-random scenarios.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

The Catalog contains variant-trait associations and supporting metadata for &amp;gt;45 000 published GWAS across &amp;gt;5000 human traits, and &amp;gt;40 000 full P-value summary statistics datasets. Content is curated from publications or acquired via author submission of prepublication summary statistics through a new submission portal and validation tool. GWAS data volume has vastly increased in recent years. We have updated our software to meet this scaling challenge and to enable rapid release of submitted summary statistics. The scope of the repository has expanded to include additional data types of high interest to the community, including sequencing-based GWAS, gene-based analyses and copy number variation analyses. Community outreach has increased the number of shared datasets from under-represented traits, e.g. cancer, and we continue to contribute to awareness of the lack of population diversity in GWAS. Interoperability of the Catalog has been enhanced through links to other resources including the Polygenic Score Catalog and the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium, refinements to GWAS trait annotation, and the development of a standard format for GWAS data.</jats:p>",

To provide interpretable results, methods have incorporated biological priors directly into the learning task; one such biological prior is pathway structure.

Our method encodes pathway information by restricting the structure of our VAE to mirror gene-pathway memberships. Its architecture is composed of a set of subnetworks, which we refer to as pathway modules. The subnetworks learn interpretable latent representations by factorizing the latent space according to pathway gene sets. We directly address correlation between pathways by balancing a module-specific local loss and a global reconstruction loss. Furthermore, since many pathways are by nature hierarchical and therefore the product of multiple downstream signals, we model each pathway as a multidimensional vector. Due to their factorization over pathways, the representations allow for easy and interpretable analysis of multiple downstream effects, such as cell type and biological stimulus, within the contexts of each pathway. We compare pmVAE against two other state-of-the-art methods on two single-cell RNA-seq case-control data sets, demonstrating that our pathway representations are both more discriminative and consistent in detecting pathways targeted by a perturbation.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Availability and implementation</jats:title><jats:p><jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"https://github.com/ratschlab/pmvae\">https://github.com/ratschlab/pmvae</jats:ext-link></jats:p></jats:sec>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>PWAS (Proteome-Wide Association Study) is an innovative genetic association approach that complements widely-used methods like GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Study). The PWAS platform involves consecutive phases. Initially, machine learning modeling and probabilistic considerations quantified the impact of genetic variants on protein-coding genes’ biochemical functions. Secondly, aggregating the variants per gene for each individual determines a gene-damaging score. Finally, standard statistical tests are activated in the case-control setting to yield statistically significant genes per phenotype. The PWAS Hub offers a user-friendly interface for an in-depth exploration of gene-disease associations from the UK Biobank (UKB). Results from PWAS cover 99 common diseases and conditions, each with over 10,000 diagnosed individuals per phenotype. Users can explore genes associated with these diseases, with separate analyses conducted for males and females. The PWAS Hub lists statistically significant genes associated with common diseases. It also indicates whether the analyzed damaged gene is associated with an increased or decreased risk. For each phenotype, the analyses account for sex-based genetic effects, inheritance modes (dominant and recessive), and the pleiotropic nature of associated genes. The PWAS Hub showcases its usefulness by navigating through such proteomic-genetic application for asthma. Graphical tools facilitate comparing genetic effects between the results of PWAS and coding GWAS, aiding in understanding the sex-specific genetic impact on common diseases. This adaptable platform is attractive for clinicians, researchers, and individuals interested in delving into gene-disease associations and sex-specific genetic effects.

Because many of the discoveries have been single-nucleotide variants with small to moderate effects on disease, the functional implication of many of the variants is still unknown and, thus, we have limited new drug targets and therapeutics. We, and many others, posit that one primary factor that has limited our ability to identify novel drug targets from genome-wide association studies may be due to gene interactions (epistasis), gene–environment interactions, network/pathway effects, or multiomic relationships. We propose that many of these complex models explain much of the underlying genetic architecture of complex disease. In this review, we discuss the evidence from multiple research avenues, ranging from pairs of alleles to multiomic integration studies and pharmacogenomics, that supports the need for further investigation of gene interactions (or epistasis) in genetic and genomic studies of human disease. Our goal is to catalog the mounting evidence for epistasis in genetic studies and the connections between genetic interactions and human health and disease that could enable precision medicine of the future.</jats:p>",

Deep learning methods, when applied to these data, highlight important regulatory sequence elements and predict the functional effects of genetic variants.

Subsequently, it tests whether the gene exhibits functional variability between individuals that correlates with the phenotype of interest. PWAS can capture complex modes of heritability, including recessive inheritance. A comparison with GWAS and other existing methods proves its capacity to recover causal protein-coding genes and highlight new associations. PWAS is available as a command-line tool.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Genome-wide association studies have shown unequivocally that common complex disorders have a polygenic genetic architecture and have enabled researchers to identify genetic variants associated with diseases. These variants can be combined into a polygenic risk score that captures part of an individual’s susceptibility to diseases. Polygenic risk scores have been widely applied in research studies, confirming the association between the scores and disease status, but their clinical utility has yet to be established. Polygenic risk scores may be used to estimate an individual’s lifetime genetic risk of disease, but the current discriminative ability is low in the general population. Clinical implementation of polygenic risk score (PRS) may be useful in cohorts where there is a higher prior probability of disease, for example, in early stages of diseases to assist in diagnosis or to inform treatment choices. Important considerations are the weaker evidence base in application to non-European ancestry and the challenges in translating an individual’s PRS from a percentile of a normal distribution to a lifetime disease risk. In this review, we consider how PRS may be informative at different points in the disease trajectory giving examples of progress in the field and discussing obstacles that need to be addressed before clinical implementation.</jats:p>",

The variability in risk and outcomes in these diseases are incompletely explained by genetics or environmental risk factors individually. Therefore, researchers are now exploring the epigenome, a biological interface at which genetics and the environment can interact. There is a growing body of evidence supporting the role of epigenetic mechanisms in complex disease pathophysiology. Epigenome-wide association studies (EWASes) investigate the association between a phenotype and epigenetic variants, most commonly DNA methylation. The decreasing cost of measuring epigenome-wide methylation and the increasing accessibility of bioinformatic pipelines have contributed to the rise in EWASes published in recent years. Here, we review the current literature on these EWASes and provide further recommendations and strategies for successfully conducting them. We have constrained our review to studies using methylation data as this is the most studied epigenetic mechanism; microarray-based data as whole-genome bisulphite sequencing remains prohibitively expensive for most laboratories; and blood-based studies due to the non-invasiveness of peripheral blood collection and availability of archived DNA, as well as the accessibility of publicly available blood-cell-based methylation data. Further, we address multiple novel areas of EWAS analysis that have not been covered in previous reviews: (1) longitudinal study designs, (2) the chip analysis methylation pipeline (ChAMP), (3) differentially methylated region (DMR) identification paradigms, (4) methylation quantitative trait loci (methQTL) analysis, (5) methylation age analysis and (6) identifying cell-specific differential methylation from mixed cell data using statistical deconvolution.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Transcriptomes are known to organize themselves into gene co-expression clusters or modules where groups of genes display distinct patterns of coordinated or synchronous expression across independent biological samples. The functional significance of these co-expression clusters is suggested by the fact that highly coexpressed groups of genes tend to be enriched in genes involved in common functions and biological processes. While gene co-expression is widely assumed to reflect close regulatory proximity, the validity of this assumption remains unclear. Here we use a simple synthetic gene regulatory network (GRN) model and contrast the resulting co-expression structure produced by these networks with their known regulatory architecture and with the co-expression structure measured in available human expression data. Using randomization tests, we found that the levels of co-expression observed in simulated expression data were, just as with empirical data, significantly higher than expected by chance. When examining the source of correlated expression, we found that individual regulators, both in simulated and experimental data, fail, on average, to display correlated expression with their immediate targets. However, highly correlated gene pairs tend to share at least one common regulator, while most gene pairs sharing common regulators do not necessarily display correlated expression. Our results demonstrate that widespread co-expression naturally emerges in regulatory networks, and that it is a reliable and direct indicator of active co-regulation in a given cellular context.</jats:p>",

However, genes are regulated in complex networks, not as individual entities, limiting the interpretability of gene expression data. Machine learning models that incorporate prior biological knowledge are a powerful tool to extract meaningful biology from gene expression data. Pathway-level information extractor (PLIER) is an unsupervised machine learning method that defines biological pathways by leveraging the vast amount of published transcriptomic data. PLIER converts gene expression data into known pathway gene sets, termed latent variables (LVs), to substantially reduce data dimensionality and improve interpretability. In the current study, we trained the first mouse PLIER model on 190,111 mouse brain RNA-sequencing samples, the greatest amount of training data ever used by PLIER. We then validated the mousiPLIER approach in a study of microglia and astrocyte gene expression across mouse brain aging. mousiPLIER identified biological pathways that are significantly associated with aging, including one latent variable (LV41) corresponding to striatal signal. To gain further insight into the genes contained in LV41, we performed<jats:italic>k</jats:italic>-means clustering on the training data to identify studies that respond strongly to LV41. We found that the variable was relevant to striatum and aging across the scientific literature. Finally, we built a Web server (<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"http://mousiplier.greenelab.com/\">http://mousiplier.greenelab.com/</jats:ext-link>) for users to easily explore the learned latent variables.

Despite remarkable success in uncovering many risk variants and providing novel insights into disease biology, genetic variants identified to date fail to explain the vast majority of the heritability for most complex diseases. One explanation is that there are still a large number of common variants that remain to be discovered, but their effect sizes are generally too small to be detected individually. Accordingly, gene set analysis of GWAS, which examines a group of functionally related genes, has been proposed as a complementary approach to single-marker analysis. Here, we propose a flexible and adaptive test for gene sets (FLAGS), using summary statistics. Extensive simulations showed that this method has an appropriate type I error rate and outperforms existing methods with increased power. As a proof of principle, through real data analyses of Crohn’s disease GWAS data and bipolar disorder GWAS meta-analysis results, we demonstrated the superior performance of FLAGS over several state-of-the-art association tests for gene sets. Our method allows for the more powerful application of gene set analysis to complex diseases, which will have broad use given that GWAS summary results are increasingly publicly available.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Since their inception, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than a hundred thousand single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci that are associated with various complex human diseases or traits. The majority of GWAS discoveries are located in non-coding regions of the human genome and have unknown functions. The valley between non-coding GWAS discoveries and downstream affected genes hinders the investigation of complex disease mechanism and the utilization of human genetics for the improvement of clinical care. Meanwhile, advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies reveal important genomic regulatory roles that non-coding regions play in the transcriptional activities of genes. In this review, we focus on data integrative bioinformatics methods that combine GWAS with functional genomics knowledge to identify genetically regulated genes. We categorize and describe two types of data integrative methods. First, we describe fine-mapping methods. Fine-mapping is an exploratory approach that calibrates likely causal variants underneath GWAS signals. Fine-mapping methods connect GWAS signals to potentially causal genes through statistical methods and/or functional annotations. Second, we discuss gene-prioritization methods. These are hypothesis generating approaches that evaluate whether genetic variants regulate genes via certain genetic regulatory mechanisms to influence complex traits, including colocalization, mendelian randomization, and the transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS). TWAS is a gene-based association approach that investigates associations between genetically regulated gene expression and complex diseases or traits. TWAS has gained popularity over the years due to its ability to reduce multiple testing burden in comparison to other variant-based analytic approaches. Multiple types of TWAS methods have been developed with varied methodological designs and biological hypotheses over the past 5 years. We dive into discussions of how TWAS methods differ in many aspects and the challenges that different TWAS methods face. Overall, TWAS is a powerful tool for identifying complex trait-associated genes. With the advent of single-cell sequencing, chromosome conformation capture, gene editing technologies, and multiplexing reporter assays, we are expecting a more comprehensive understanding of genomic regulation and genetically regulated genes underlying complex human diseases and traits in the future.</jats:p>",

We focus on the fundamental topological indicator, namely connectivity, and evaluate its performance when applied to cancer-affected genes using statistical indices. Our findings reveal that ncRNAs significantly enhance the connectivity of affected genes and mediate the inclusion of more genes in the cancer module. To further explore the role of ncRNAs in the network, we propose a connectivity-based method which leverages the bridging function of ncRNAs across cancer-affected genes and reveals the non-coding RNAs extended omnigenic module (NeOModule). Topologically, this module promotes the formation of cancer patterns involving ncRNAs.
