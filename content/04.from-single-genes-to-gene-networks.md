### Omnigenic model as a framework for deciphering genetic architecture of traits

In the early 20th century, Mendelian geneticists,  focused on traits determined by single genes where the segregation of alleles follows predictable patterns, debated with biometricians who studied continuously varying traits and argued that Mendelian inheritance could not explain the phenotypic distributions observed in populations.
This conflict highlighted a fundamental question: how can discrete genetic factors produce continuous phenotypic variation? [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.038; @doi:10.1073/pnas.2005634117].
The debate was resolved by R.
A.
Fisher in 1918 through the introduction of the infinitesimal model [@doi:10.1017/S0080456800012163].
Fisher demonstrated that if numerous genes influence a trait, the random assortment of alleles at these genes would produce a continuous distribution of phenotypes in a population.
This model reconciled Mendelian inheritance with the observed correlations between relatives for quantitative traits and provided a statistical framework for understanding complex trait inheritance.
Despite the success of Fisher’s infinitesimal model, the actual number of genes involved in complex traits and the magnitude of their effects remained uncertain for much of the 20th century.
Translating genotypes into phenotypes proved challenging due to the complexity of the genetic mechanisms driving trait variation.
The advent of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) brought new hope for identifying specific genetic variants with functional effects on complex traits.
GWAS allowed researchers to scan the entire genome for associations between genetic polymorphisms and traits of interest.

Over a decade of Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) has led to several unexpected findings:
The strongest GWAS associations exhibit modest effect sizes on disease risk, collectively accounting for only a minor fraction of the predicted heritability (often termed "missing heritability") [@doi:10.1038/nature08494].
It is now understood that much of this missing heritability arises from a vast number of common variants with small effects that remain undetected in current sample sizes [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1008222].
A surprising uniform distribution of these small-effect significant variants exists throughout the genome, including noncoding regions, with a notable concentration in regulatory elements such as enhancers and promoters [@doi:10.1038/nature08185; @doi:10.1146/annurev-biodatasci-122120-110102].
For instance, is estimated that 71%–100% of 1-MB windows in the genome contribute to heritability for schizophrenia [@doi:10.1038/ng.3431].
A broader influence of the entire genome on phenotypic outcomes, not only genes with direct biological links to specific phenotypes, drives trait variation.
The notion that nearly all genomic variants could have direct additive effects on a specific phenotype is biologically improbable.
[@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.038]
To reconcile these findings, Boyle et al.
proposed the omnigenic model  [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.038], a conceptual framework in which the genetic architecture of complex traits could be explained by highly interconnected gene regulatory networks.
The omnigenic model reframes the earlier infinitesimal model by distinguishing between “core genes”, which have a direct biological role in the disease or trait, and peripheral genes, which influence core genes and thus indirectly affect the disease or trait through regulatory networks [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.038].
The omnigenic model, unlike the traditional infinitesimal model, offers a mechanistic rationale for complex traits architecture based on molecular and cellular biology, understanding the molecular pathways that connect genetic variation to phenotypic traits (**Figure {@fig:fig2}**).

The key proposals of this model are: 1) nearly all genes expressed in cells relevant to the trait have the potential to impact the regulation of core genes 2) that for typical traits, nearly all heritability is attributable to variation near peripheral genes.
Consequently, while core genes function as the primary drivers of disease, it is the cumulative effects of numerous peripheral gene variants that determine polygenic risk [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2019.04.014].
This framework provides a possible explanation for several previously identified problems, including widespread pleiotropy (the ability of a single gene to affect multiple traits), polygenicity (the involvement of many genes in the manifestation of a single trait), the bias effect size where small-effect variants can collectively account for a large portion of heritability, and the uniform distribution across the genome.

### *Trans* effects in the omnigenic model: a step toward decoding complex traits?

The omnigenic model, though providing a comprehensive framework for understanding the diffuse heritability observed in GWAS, has faced several criticisms.
One key concern is its lack of clear, quantitative methods for identifying peripheral genes or estimating their contribution to heritability.
The model suggests that most genetic effects arise from these peripheral genes, yet it remains unclear how to define and measure these effects statistically.
[@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2018.05.051].
Trans effects occur when a genetic variant at one locus affects the expression of genes at distant loci, often on different chromosomes.
This contrasts with cis effects, where variants influence genes in their immediate vicinity.
In this context, understanding *trans* effects is crucial for grasping the indirect influence of peripheral genes on core traits [@doi:10.20900/jpbs.20170014S2].

However, the study of trans effects has inherent challenges.
One of the primary limitations is their typically small effect sizes, which makes their detection difficult compared to cis effects.
Despite this, research indicates that most of the heritability in complex traits is controlled through trans effects rather than cis effects [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2019.04.014].
This apparent paradox can be explained by the action of natural selection: it tends to act most strongly against variants with large effects, thereby limiting the potential contribution of genes with the most direct biological importance to heritability [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2019.04.014].
Consequently, genes that are biologically critical for a trait might contribute less to heritability because their large-effect variants are more constrained by natural selection [@doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.2002985].

Given that a significant portion of trait heritability appears to be driven by a vast number of peripheral variants functioning as weak trans effects for core genes, peripheral gene regulatory variants can become notable contributors if they influence many core genes in a coordinated direction.
When these trans-regulators act on multiple core genes correlatedly, their cumulative effects can substantially impact the trait.
By accounting for this additive effect, we can gain enough power to detect these trans effects, thereby understanding their contribution.

### Success stories of the omnigenic model

Since the introduction of the omnigenic model, numerous studies have adopted it as a framework to deepen our understanding of the genetic architecture of complex traits and the molecular mechanisms that drive them.

In schizophrenia, the application of the omnigenic model has revealed specific core gene sets associated with the disorder.
Notably, the *TCF4* gene set maintained its significant impact even after excluding SNPs within the *TCF4* gene itself.
This finding suggests that peripheral genes within the set contribute to the development of schizophrenia.
Additionally, the observed systematic floor effect across polygenic scores aligns with the model's prediction that most genes expressed in relevant cells contribute to heritability, thereby highlighting the model's potential in uncovering the broad genetic contributions to complex psychiatric conditions [@doi:10.1038/s41386-019-0410-z].

Empirical support for the omnigenic theory extends beyond human diseases.
Sundell et al.
demonstrated this concept in European black poplars, showing that both core and peripheral genes play a crucial role in predicting phenotypes.
While core genes are indeed important, the information they provide must be complemented by other genes to ensure accurate phenotype predictions.
Furthermore, peripheral genes were found to carry significant biological information contributing to robust predictions [@doi:10.1186/s12864-020-06809-2].

Li et al. (2024) identified a significantly connected subgraph formed by cancer-affected coding genes and ncRNAs by focusing on connectivity as a key topological feature.
 This approach highlighted the essential role of ncRNAs in linking fragmented cancer-affected genes, consistent with the omnigenic framework's premise that peripheral genes, including non-coding elements, contribute to complex traits such as cancer.
Importantly, the inclusion of ncRNAs enhanced the identification of cancer-related pathways, indicating that a comprehensive network model encompassing ncRNAs is more effective in characterizing disease relationships than models concentrating solely on coding genes.
[@doi:10.3390/e26080640].

### Limitations of the omnigenic model: from a theoretical to a practical approach
In essence, the omnigenic model proposes a specific mechanism: that the genetic architecture of complex traits is intrinsically interconnected, involving a multitude of genes that contribute to phenotypic variation both directly (core genes) and indirectly (peripheral genes).
This framework facilitates an understanding of the highly polygenic and often subtle genetic effects on complex traits, shifting the focus from individual genes to gene networks.
However, the authors of omnigenic model proposed a set of equations to explain these interactions that contain many parameters that need to be fit, making it hard to implement from a practical point of view.
Moreover, the model exhibits certain limitations: (1) One limitation lies in the model's reliance on network pleiotropy to explain the dominance of peripheral gene effects.
While it suggests that peripheral genes influence core genes through shared cellular networks, the model does propose a practical way to fully capture the complexity of these networks.
 (2) The model also faces limitations in comprehending trans effects.
As previously discussed, the signals of trans effects are sometimes insufficiently detectable.
(3) It does not account for gene-environment interactions, assuming additivity as the basis for heritability estimates.
Consequently, the multifactorial effects of variants influencing the expression profiles of core genes remain unclear and are largely overlooked, not due to a lack of evidence but rather due to insufficient data integration [@doi:10.1146/annurev-biodatasci-102022-120818; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1008519].
(4) There are challenges regarding the interpretability of the model and the translation of these theoretical concepts into a practical framework.

cristisim from 2019 omingenic paper revision: In this study, we have defined core genes in line with the definition from Liu et al., 2019.
In that light, a transcription factor that regulates other core genes would be a peripheral gene, or perhaps a master regulator if it simultaneously regulates multiple core genes.
However, as defined by Liu et al., we consider signaling receptors, such as the androgen receptor for testosterone, to be core even though they are transcription factors, since they directly receive inputs from outside the cell.
Transcription factors that act within a cellular regulatory network , rather than directly receiving inputs from outside the cell, would be considered peripheral.
Nevertheless, we admit that this is a simplified, conceptual model, such that not all genes will fit neatly into these definitions.
We have made these points more clearly in the Introduction.
As George E.
P.
Box stated, "All models are wrong, but some are useful" We acknowledge that the omnigenic model simplifies biological complexity and may not be universally applicable to all complex traits.
Nevertheless, it remains a valuable framework for interpreting genetic signals.
This model proposes an explicit mechanism of gene-gene interactions and offers a pragmatic approach to understanding gene networks and their interactions, thereby facilitating insights into the underlying mechanisms of genetic influences on traits.

what we care the most is the network not the number of genes
framework starting point, some points are good other not  
We propose advancing the omnigenic model by developing computational frameworks based on this concept to infer gene-gene networks, termed machine learning-derived gene modules, to ground these theoretical ideas into practical applications.
Additionally, integrating multiple layers of omics data (genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic) can (1) enhance our understanding of complex biological networks and (2) provide sufficient information to improve the accuracy and comprehension of trans effect detection.
Since trans effects are mediated by mechanisms such as transcription factors, non-coding RNAs, epigenetic modifications, and chromatin remodeling complexes that regulate gene expression across the genome, incorporating these data types is essential.
