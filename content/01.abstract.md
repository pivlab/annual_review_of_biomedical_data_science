## Abstract {.page_break_before}

The longstanding challenge in genomics is to understand the genetic basis of complex traits.
While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of variant-trait associations, most of these variants reside in non-coding regions, complicating the link to biological function.
Traditional methods, such as transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), have improved our understanding by connecting genetic variants to gene expression but often neglect gene-gene interactions.
In this paper, we address this gap by exploring approaches that use gene modules to integrate various molecular data.
We propose leveraging machine learning techniques to identify gene modules based on co-expression and functional relationships.
Our focus is on integrative methods like PhenoPLIER, which combine TWAS with drug-induced transcriptional profiles to effectively capture biologically meaningful gene networks.
This integration provides a context-specific understanding of disease processes and highlights both core and peripheral genes.
Our findings open avenues for novel therapeutic targets and enhance the interpretability of genetic studies in personalized medicine.
