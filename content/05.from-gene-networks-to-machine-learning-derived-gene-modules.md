**a)**.
Real biological network, where nodes represent genes and edges denote the relationships between them.
It captures all possible patterns that can link genes.
Some of these relationships are gene co-expression patterns, which transcriptomics can capture, such as linear relationships between Gene A and Gene B.
Other patterns, such as protein-protein interactions between Gene C and Gene D, are not captured by transcriptomics and are thus not reflected in the co-expression analysis.
**b).** Different approaches for capturing machine learning-derived gene modules.
In this example, transcriptome data is used as input, but other data types such as methylomics, proteomics, and metabolomics can also be applied.
The first row illustrates the PLIER method, which uses non-negative matrix factorization to align gene expression data with known biological pathways by incorporating prior knowledge into its gene modules.
This approach generates interpretable gene modules but only captures linear relationships.
The second row shows a Vanilla VAE, which can capture both linear and nonlinear patterns but does not integrate prior knowledge, resulting in less interpretable gene modules.
The third row highlights the interpretable VAE, which incorporates prior knowledge into its decoder, achieving a balance between capturing complex relationships and maintaining biological interpretability.

## From single gene analysis to gene module discovery with machine learning approaches

High-throughput technologies, particularly genome-wide gene expression profiling tools such as RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and microarrays, have fundamentally transformed the landscape of molecular biology.
Unlike traditional gene-by-gene approaches, RNA-seq and microarrays offer a comprehensive view of the transcriptomic landscape [@doi:10.1038/s41598-022-23985-1].
These advancements, alongside conceptual frameworks like the omnigenic model, have facilitated a paradigm shift from a single-gene perspective to a module-based approach, wherein groups of genes rather than individual genes are essential for elucidating the complexities of biological networks [@doi:10.1016/j.copbio.2008.07.011].

Gene modules, represented as coexpression networks, consist of nodes (genes) and edges that reflect coexpression relationships between them and are a key type of biological network (**Figure {@fig:fig3}a)**).
These modules, formed by functionally related genes with coordinated expression patterns under specific biological conditions, not only reveal coexpression but also provide valuable insights into regulatory mechanisms, gene functions, and the pathways involved in disease [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0247671].

Numerous approaches and algorithms have been proposed for module detection in gene expression data.
ML techniques are particularly proficient at addressing common challenges in omics data, such as data sparsity and high dimensionality.
ML methods can compress correlations into lower-dimensional representations, facilitating the processing of large datasets to identify intricate coexpression patterns.
Additionally, ML approaches are capable of integrating various types of omics data enhancing the detection of gene modules, providing a more comprehensive understanding of biological networks [@doi:10.1038/s41540-023-00312-6].

In this context, unsupervised ML approaches have gained significant popularity [@doi:10.1126/scitranslmed.aag3101].
These methods facilitate the discovery of patterns and structures within the data without requiring prior knowledge of the system, allowing for the inference of novel findings and hypotheses.
This capability is particularly advantageous for gene module inference, which aims to identify groups of coexpressed and potentially co-regulated genes that contribute to similar biological functions [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03424-4].

In this section, we will focus on decomposition and deep learning methods for inferring gene modules, highlighting their effectiveness in uncovering complex gene interactions and enhancing our understanding of biological networks (**Figure {@fig:fig3}b)**).
However, we acknowledge that utilizing transcriptional data alone is insufficient for fully comprehending the intricate system of biological networks; it serves as an initial step toward a more comprehensive understanding.

### Decomposition methods

Decomposition methods reduce complex, high-dimensional gene expression data into simpler components, revealing underlying patterns and structures that aid in interpreting large-scale datasets.
These methods provide flexible approaches that handle local co-expression and overlap, making them especially powerful for large-scale and complex gene expression datasets since can capture context-specific co-expression and overlapping modules common in biological networks [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03424-4].

Simple models like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) have traditionally been used to reduce dimensionality in gene expression data, offering a basic understanding of co-expressed genes [@doi:10.1088/1478-3975/acce8d].
However, these models often lack the ability to incorporate prior biological knowledge, which limits their interpretability and biological relevance.
To overcome these limitations, more sophisticated approaches such as the Pathway-Level Information Extractor (PLIER) [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1], or  GenomicSuperSignature [@doi:10.1038/s41467-022-31411-3] have been developed.
These methodologies combine unsupervised approaches (decomposition methodologies) with supervised approaches to annotate the gene modules with prior biological knowledge.

GenomicSuperSignature employs principal component analysis (PCA) to identify gene modules applying prior knowledge for biological annotation after module discovery.
This flexibility allows it to adapt to novel datasets and provides computational efficiency, even with large datasets.
However, the lack of prior knowledge integration during training can result in modules that are less biologically interpretable compared to those from PLIER-based methods [@doi:10.1038/s41467-022-31411-3].

In contrast, PLIER is based on a non-negative matrix factorization method, and aligns gene expression data with known biological pathways by incorporating prior knowledge into its gene modules.
This method offers high interpretability by ensuring that a proportion of the gene modules align with specific biological pathways, enabling direct links between the inferred gene modules and known biological functions (**Figure {@fig:fig3}b)**).
Notably, PLIER also reserves a subset of gene modules that do not align with pathways, allowing researchers to separate novel biology from technical artifacts.
While PLIER is scalable and effective for large RNA-seq datasets, its reliance on existing pathway information can sometimes limit its ability to explore unknown or poorly understood biological systems.
As PLIER uses prior knowledge to overcome the limitations of co-expression methods like Pearson or Spearman correlation, which can miss key causal gene expression changes due to confounding factors like cell type variability, allowing it to focus on biologically meaningful signals amidst complex gene-expression patterns.[@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1008519] .
Building upon PLIER, the MultiPLIER framework was developed to integrate large scale gene expression data and utilize transfer learning, incorporating information from multiple cell types and conditions [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003].
An example of this is its application to large datasets like recount2, a resource containing harmonized RNA-seq data from various experiments.
MultiPLIER leverages these vast datasets to improve the accuracy of inferred gene modules by identifying patterns consistent across diverse data types and conditions.
Most gene expression datasets, especially those related to rare diseases, are often too small to fully benefit from unsupervised machine learning.
To overcome this limitation, MultiPLIER employs transfer learning by training a PLIER model on a large public data compendium and then applying it to small datasets.
This approach generates models that align well with known biological factors and are more comprehensive than models trained on individual datasets.
When applied to rare disease datasets, these models effectively capture biological processes related to disease severity.
It's worth noting that MultiPLIER allows for the simultaneous integration of multiple datasets, improving the interpretability and reliability of gene expression patterns across different experimental contexts.
In contrast, PLIER is better suited for analyzing a single dataset in a biologically informed manner.
PLIER can also be use in a specific cohort context, focuses on dissecting specific traits within more homogenous datasets., applied to smaller, more condition-specific datasets, as opposed to the MultiPLIER/recount2 model, which is based on more general, heterogeneous datasets.
Its utility have been showed by Nandi et al with the omniPLIER model, where they identify gene modules which mediating the effect of karyotype on body mass index in Down syndrome, revealing key regulators like *GPX1* and *MCL1* (Nandi et al., 2024).
This allows it to capture condition-specific regulatory mechanisms, but at the expense of broader generalizability, making it a powerful tool for understanding unique biological processes within specialized groups.

PLIER, initially designed for human gene expression data, has been successfully adapted for use in other species, demonstrating its versatility across different biological contexts.
By extending the framework to model organisms, researchers can infer gene modules in species beyond humans, expanding the utility of PLIER for comparative studies and translational research.
One such adaptation is MousiPLIER, which tailors the PLIER framework for use in mouse models, a widely used system in biomedical research.

### Deep learning methods: autoencoders

However, decomposition methods can only infer linear patterns.
In contrast to these linear methods, non-linear models, such as deep learning (DL) approaches, can capture more complex patterns in the data.

A large set of tools based on DL approaches showed success in predicting gene expression directly from sequence [@doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0160-6; @doi:10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107663; @doi:10.1016/j.crmeth.2023.100580]
Deep learning methods like autoencoders are particularly effective for inferring gene modules because they can capture non-linear patterns in gene expression data, unlike traditional linear decomposition methods.
Moreover, they can handle very high-dimensional data.
By using neural networks to learn compressed representations, autoencoders identify complex dependencies between genes, making them well-suited for uncovering gene modules.
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) (**Figure {@fig:fig3}b)**) enhance this process by encoding data into a continuous latent space, enabling dimensionality reduction and the generation of new data.
However, a major limitation of VAEs is their lack of biological interpretability, as they do not incorporate prior knowledge [@doi:10.1093/gigascience/giaa082].
To overcome this, models like the Pathway Module VAE (pmVAE) integrate biological pathway information into the autoencoder framework, improving interpretability [@doi:10.1101/2021.01.28.428664] (**Figure {@fig:fig3}a)**).
Another example is expiMap [@doi:10.1038/s41556-022-01072-x], a biologically informed model that refines known gene programs while discovering novel ones.
This approach has proven successful in analyzing cross-dataset variations and applications such as studying COVID-19 patient responses, demonstrating the importance of combining VAEs with prior biological knowledge to enhance both inference and interpretability.
Additionally, beyond autoencoder-based methods, other correlation-based approaches, such as,  the cluster-match correlation coefficient (CCC) have been developed to quantify both linear and non-linear correlations between genes in complex gene expression datasets.
Unlike traditional correlation measures (e.g.
Pearson correlation coefficient), which are limited to assessing linear associations between continuous data, CCC focuses on comparing how different gene expression profiles group or cluster data points, making it particularly effective in biological contexts where non-linearity often exists.
By examining the alignment of clusters across different gene expression categories, CCC provides a more flexible approach to detect complex relationships that are not apparent through linear models alone.
This is critical in gene expression data, where intricate regulatory networks and non-linear interactions between genes frequently occur, making CCC a powerful tool for uncovering deeper insights into gene functions and associations.
[@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2024.08.005].
While powerful in capturing intricate gene relationships and integrating multi-omics data, these non-linear models often face challenges in biological interpretability.
