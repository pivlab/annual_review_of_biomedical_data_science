## Introduction

Understanding the genetics of complex traits is a major challenge in modern genomics.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have played a crucial role in advancing our knowledge by identifying links between genetic variants and traits.
This has helped us understand the genetic makeup of various diseases and phenotypic conditions.
Since the first GWAS on age-related macular degeneration in 2005, the GWAS catalog has expanded to include over 5,000 human traits.
It now identifies risk loci for conditions such as type 2 diabetes, schizophrenia, and rheumatoid arthritis [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkac1010, @doi:10.1038/s41576-019-0127-1, @doi:10.1038/s41588-022-01213-w].
Despite these advances, most variants identified by GWAS are located in non-coding regions, highlighting the crucial role of gene regulation in creating phenotypic diversity [@doi:10.1093/hmg/ddac198; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776].
This presents a significant challenge in converting GWAS findings into biological insights.

To overcome the limitations of traditional genetic studies, various methods have been developed to connect GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Studies) variants with functional outcomes.
One common approach is proximity-based methods, like MAGMA, which link GWAS variants to nearby genes based on their physical distance [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004219].
However, these methods might overlook variants that act over long distances.
For example, variants in the *FTO* locus, associated with obesity, affect the *IRX3* gene through long-range interactions [@doi:10.1038/nature13138].
While useful, proximity-based approaches can miss causal genes if they are not the closest ones.
Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) offer a more comprehensive approach by connecting genetic variants to gene expression.
This method enhances our ability to identify potentially causal genes for various traits [@doi:10.3389/fgene.2021.713230, @doi:10.1038/s41588-019-0385-z].
TWAS uses expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data to prioritize genes affected by GWAS variants, providing a clearer link between genetic variation and phenotypic changes.
However, TWAS and similar methods often focus on individual genes or variants, neglecting the complex interactions among genes that are crucial for understanding complex traits [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.038].

The omnigenic model, introduced by Boyle et al.
[@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.038], suggests that the genetic makeup of complex traits involves networks of interconnected genes.
In this model, core genes have a direct impact on a trait, while peripheral genes influence these core genes through regulatory networks.
This perspective highlights the importance of developing methods that can capture the polygenic and network-based interactions present in complex diseases.
Machine learning techniques, especially those that utilize gene co-expression patterns, are well-suited for this purpose.
Approaches like non-negative matrix factorization and variational autoencoders (VAEs) have shown success in identifying biologically meaningful gene modules, which are groups of genes that exhibit coordinated expression under specific conditions [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1, @doi:10.1038/s41467-021-26017-0].

In this review, we explore current methods that use gene modules to integrate genetic studies with various data types.
We discuss how combining machine learning-derived gene modules with genetic and multi-omics data can improve our understanding of complex traits and diseases.
We specifically highlight the PhenoPLIER framework [@doi:10.1038/s41467-023-41057-4], which merges gene modules from transcriptome data with Transcriptome-Wide Association Studies (TWAS) and drug-induced transcriptional profiles to reveal disease-related molecular mechanisms.
This approach goes beyond single-gene analyses by capturing the broader gene networks that influence phenotypic outcomes.
It offers a deeper understanding of the molecular basis of complex human traits and paves the way for more effective, personalized therapeutic strategies.
