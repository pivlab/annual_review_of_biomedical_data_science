## Single variant / single gene approaches 

![
**Major approaches based on single variant/single gene strategies to understand the genetic basis of complex traits**.
GWAS identifies associations between DNA variants and traits.
All the other approaches test how different molecular mechanisms might mediate variant-trait associations from GWAS.
TWAS uses variants linked to changes in gene expression (i.e., expression quantitative trait loci or eQTLs).
PWAS links protein functionality to traits via protein QTLs (pQTLs).
HAWAS maps histone modifications to traits using hQTLs, while MWAS explores DNA methylation patterns in relation to traits through mQTLs.

### From genetic variants to traits: genome-wide association study

In a simple trait, a single gene can be responsible for the disease (monogenic), for example in the case of Sickle Cell Anemia and Huntington's disease.
However, most traits are not so simplistic and are the result of many mutations across the genome (polygenic).
Even monogenic traits can sometimes be influenced by the polygenic background [@doi:10.1038/s41467-020-17374-3].
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) examine the relationship between specific genetic variants and phenotypes by comparing allele frequencies in individuals of similar ancestry with distinct phenotypic traits (**Figure {@fig:fig1}**).
Both causal and non-causal variants are found to be significant and due to the phenomena of linkage disequilibrium, the results of GWAS are often grouped into risk loci.
These loci represent clusters of variants that demonstrate significant associations, although not every variant may be causal [@doi:10.1186/s13059-022-02697-9].

Since the first GWAS on age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in 2005, the GWAS catalog rapidly expanded, containing SNP-trait associations across >5,000 human traits [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkac1010].
These studies have successfully identified risk loci for a variety of traits such as type 2 diabetes, auto-immune disease, schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and many more [@doi:10.1038/s41576-019-0127-1; @doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2017.06.005].
As GWAS participants increase, more loci are able to be identified.
For example, a study investigating insomnia with a sample size of >1M identified 202 risk loci [@doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0333-3], compared to earlier studies with a sample size of ~110,00, which were only able to identify 3 risk loci [@doi:10.1038/ng.3888].
Beyond the identification of risk loci, GWAS have also led to the discovery of novel biological mechanisms in Crohn’s disease [@doi:10.1038/ng1954; @doi:10.1038/nature13044], rheumatoid arthritis [@doi:10.1038/s41588-022-01213-w], and more.

Although GWAS have identified numerous genetic variants associated with complex traits, translating these findings into biological insights remains challenging [@doi:10.1038/s41576-019-0127-1].
For example, genes can have epistatic interactions where a secondary loci affects a primary loci.
The peripheral effects of the secondary loci are often too small to be picked up through GWAS alone [@doi:10.1016/j.tig.2011.05.007].
Furthermore, any significant GWAS variants are located in non-coding regions, making it difficult to identify the specific genes that drive trait associations [@doi:10.1093/hmg/ddac198].
A simple strategy to link GWAS-associated variants with a gene is by physical proximity, which typically selects the closest gene to the most significant SNP at each locus.
Approaches like MAGMA [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004219] are based on proximity to compute a gene-trait association.
However, SNPs can have distal effects on the expression of the target gene [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1126/science.1222794; @doi:10.1038/nature13138; @doi:10.1073/pnas.112212199].


Recent approaches combine multi-omics data from various cell types and tissues with GWAS to identify potential mechanisms of SNPs and the associated gene through molecular quantitative trait loci (molQTLs) [@doi:10.1016/j.molmed.2019.10.004] (Figure {@fig:fig1}).
For example, an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) is a genetic region associated with the expression levels of a nearby or distant gene [@doi:10.1016/j.jgg.2023.05.003].
eQTL studies estimate that the majority of heritability is explained by the combination of multiple weak *trans*-eQTLs [@doi:10.1038/s41588-021-00913-z].

In the next section, we briefly review computational approaches that test different molecular phenotypes via QTLs to link variants with genes.
Both GWAS and QTL studies have been penalized by their large multiple testing burden, causing the need to adopt a high level of significance.
This results in GWAS being underpowered to detect all heritability explained by SNPs [@doi:10.1038/s41576-019-0127-1].

### From GWAS to gene: transcriptome-wide association studies 

Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) integrate GWAS with gene expression data (**Figure {@fig:fig1}**) from eQTL analysis, to prioritize genes whose expression across different tissues is influenced by GWAS variants [@doi:10.3389/fgene.2021.713230; @doi:10.1038/s41588-019-0385-z].
By leveraging predicted gene expression levels, TWAS provides a mechanistic link between genetic variants and traits, allowing researchers to move beyond associations with individual SNPs to identify putatively causal genes [@doi:10.1038/s41588-019-0385-z].
Since TWAS models the genetic regulation of gene expression, the approach allows researchers to impute expression levels in GWAS cohorts where expression data may not be available.
A key advantage of TWAS over GWAS lies in its ability to increase interpretability by providing a gene-trait association: TWAS connects trait-associated SNPs (which are mostly non-coding) to genes, which are biologically functional units.

Several TWAS approaches have been introduced [@doi:10.1038/s42003-023-05279-y], including PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/ng.3367], FUSION [@doi:10.1038/ng.3506] and TIGAR [@doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2019.05.018].
However, all of them implement a similar framework that consists in three steps: 1) model training, 2) gene expression imputation, and 3) gene-trait association.
For example, during 1), PrediXcan, builds one expression prediction model per gene and tissue using penalized linear regression with ElasticNet to model sparse genetic architectures.
These models contain weights for each SNP used as predictor for a gene expression in a tissue.
Given genotype data in a cohort without measured gene expression, during 2), the SNPs weights from the models can be used to impute tissue-specific gene expression for individuals.
During 3), a gene-tissue-trait association is computed by correlating the tissue-specific imputed gene expression with the trait of interest.
Most methods (such as Summary-PrediXcan [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03621-1] or S-PrediXcan), however, offer a shortcut by computing a gene-tissue-trait association directly from GWAS summary statistics without the need of individual-level data.
This process, however, requires the user to select a tissue of interest, which might not be straightforward [@doi:10.1038/s41588-019-0385-z].
To address this limitation, approaches such as MultiXcan [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889] or UTMOST [@doi:10.1038/s41588-019-0345-7] combine information across tissues to generate a gene-trait association.
These multi-tissue approaches are generally more powerful than single-tissue ones, although they do not provide a direction of effect (i.e., whether a higher or lower predicted expression is associated with a higher or lower disease risk).

### Going beyond TWAS

The flexibility of this 3-step framework can also be used to test whether other molecular phenotypes might mediate the association between GWAS variants and a trait of interest.
In addition to integrating eQTLs, the framework has been implemented also with splicing QTLs (sQTLs), protein QTLs (pQTLs), histone acetylation QTLs (haQTLs) and methylation QTLs (mQTLs).

PWAS complements GWAS and TWAS by aggregating genetic variations in protein-coding regions to assess their combined impact on protein function and phenotype (**Figure {@fig:fig1}**) [@doi:10.1186/s13059-020-02089-x].
Unlike GWAS, which focuses on individual variants, PWAS evaluates the cumulative effects of multiple coding variants, reducing the scale of multiple testing, detecting complex inheritance patterns, and offering deeper insights into potential disease links.
PWAS employs the FIRM machine learning model to evaluate how variants—such as missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations—affect protein function by assigning impairment scores [@doi:10.1186/s13059-020-02089-x].
The aggregate effects of these variants on each gene are then assessed, followed by statistical tests to identify significant associations between gene scores and phenotypes.
For example, PWAS confirmed the association of *MUTYH* with colorectal cancer using UK Biobank data, even when no individual variant reached genome-wide significance in GWAS, highlighting its ability to uncover functional associations missed by other methods.
However, PWAS relies on high-quality proteomic data, may miss non-coding variant associations, and is computationally intensive.

Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) encompass methodologies such methylome-wide association studies (MWAS) (**Figure {@fig:fig1}**) and histone acetylome-wide association studies (HAWAS) (**Figure {@fig:fig1}**), based on haQTLs and mQLTs respectability, which focus on specific types of epigenetic modifications to reveal their roles in gene regulation and disease etiology  [@doi:10.1186/s13148-021-01200-8].
MWAS targets DNA methylation patterns, identifying loci where methylation changes are linked to particular traits or diseases.
For instance, a study by Shen et al. demonstrated a causal relationship between DNA methylation and depression, indicating that epigenetic modifications may mediate genetic risk for psychiatric disorders [@doi:10.1186/s13073-022-01039-5].
HAWAS focuses on histone acetylation modifications, which are crucial for regulating chromatin structure and gene expression.
Del Rosario et al.conducted a HAWAS identifying over 2,000 differentially acetylated loci in immune cells from Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected individuals, linking these changes to gene expression and potassium channel genes like *KCNJ15* in modulating apoptosis and Mtb clearance.
haQTL analysis further revealed variants associated with immune phenotypes, complementing GWAS findings and enhancing understanding of disease mechanisms  [@doi:10.1038/s41564-021-01049-w].
The tissue-specific nature of epigenetic modifications, alongside the capacity to capture cellular plasticity and environmental influences, enhances our insight into the effects of genetic variants across distinct tissues, temporal cellular states, and gene-environment interactions [@doi:10.3390/cells9112424; @doi:10.1016/j.placenta.2007.09.011].
Despite the advancements facilitated by single variant and single gene methodologies, a common thread persists: the focus remains on one gene at a time.
The underlying expectation is that identifying a gene linked to a trait will directly unveil the biological mechanisms driving disease processes.
While this has been successful in certain monogenic disorders, complex traits often involve intricate interactions among multiple genes and environmental factors.
Consequently, the one-gene-at-a-time paradigm may oversimplify the multifaceted nature of these traits.
In light of these considerations, it becomes imperative to reevaluate our approaches to dissecting the genetic architecture of complex traits.
This necessitates a shift towards methodologies that can capture the polygenic and network-based interactions inherent in complex diseases.
